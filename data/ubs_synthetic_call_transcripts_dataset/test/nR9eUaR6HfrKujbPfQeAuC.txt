Speaker 2:Yeah, that sounds good. What kind of fees and interest rates are we talking about?

Speaker 1:Typically, the fee for a temporary limit ranges between 1-3% of the increased amount. If the limit is increased by AMOUNT, th efee will be a small percentage of that. Additionally, any expenditure beyond your current limit might attract interest rates similar regular credit usage, usually between 10-25% APR. There’s usually a grace period 25-30 days for paying off the increased limit without incurring interest.

Speaker 2:Okay, it. And how will this affect my credit score?

Speaker 1:Temporarilyi ncreasingyour limit might slightly improve your credit utilization ratio in the short term. However, if the increased expenditure leads to a higher balance that longer to pay off, it could negtively impat your score. Responsible redit management, such as timely payments and keeping your balance within a healthy will help mitigate any adverse affects.
