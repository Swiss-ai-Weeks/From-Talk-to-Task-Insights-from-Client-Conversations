Speaker 2: Good morning. This is [Banker's from UBS. Uh, I'm calling today, actually, to a few important points, including, um, a recent card limit matter fat I understand you expensed, an update to your Know Your Customer information, just to briefly upon some futur e financial planinng. Hello, Mr./Mrs. [Client's Last Name]. How are you doing today? I you've had a recent transaction declined, and really want to assure you we'll get that sorted for you. But first, forsecurity purposes, could you please just confirm your date of birth – [Date of Birth] – and your registered address, which we have as [Client's Address], for

Speaker 1: Good morning. Uh, yes, I'm a bit anxious about this card you know, so I'm really glad we're addressing My date of birth is, uh, [Date of Birth], and my registered address is [Client's Address].

Speaker 2: Thank you, Mr./Mrs. [Client's Last Name]. I can confirm date of birth and registered address are correct. Typing on keyboard And, uh, I really do understand your anxiety regarding this card issue, and I you we will address it promptly. To help me understand exactly what happened, could you please tell me exact amount of the transaction that was and then, uh, the approximate time it occurred?

Speaker 1: (Size um, the transaction was for [Amount] [Currency] and it happened just, like, an hour ago, around [Time]. I'm quite anxious about this, you know, as it's a very important purchase that I absolutely need to complete today. What can we do right now, like, right this second, to get sorted? I'm also wonder ing why wasn't flagged sooner; I, I don't usually hit my card limit. This is really unusual.

Speaker 2: (Empathetically) [Client's Last Name], completely, completely understand your urgency, and I assure you we are working to resolve this as quickly as possible for you. It's certainly frustrating, you know, when a critic al transaction is declined. Uh, let me just pull up your details here.
System processing...
Speaker 2: Okay, looking at your account, your current card limit [Current Limit] [Currency]. It that with the [Amount] [Currency] transaction, you've just slightly exceeded it, um, due to your recent spending patterns this month. Sometimes, especially with multiple transactions in quick succession, the system might not flag it, you know, until the very moment the limit is reached. Now, to get this sorted I can process a temporary limit for you. How much above your limit do you think you'd need to cover this specific purchase and perhaps, you know, a small buffer? This temporary increase will typically be valid for, let's say, se ven days, and I can confirm there are no fees associated with this specific type of temporary adjustment. This will also reflect negatively on your credit history, which I know is a common concern. We can certainly review your overall limit permanently after this, but for now, let's focus on getting this specific transaction through.

Speaker 1: (Relieved but still anxious) Okay, oh, a temporary increase sounds like, like a huge relief . I'm so anxious to get this you know. I really, really need to complete this purchase today, so I'd appreciate it if you could increase my limit by, say, 500 [Currency] above my limit, just to be absolutely sure it covers the purchase and, you know, gives me a small buffer. So, a total temporary limit of [Current Limit + 500] [Currency]. Just clarify, you mentioned there are no fees this, it won't impact my credit history negatively, correct? And it will be valid for, uh, around seven days? I'm really, really concerned about happening again. Could you also explain a bit more aout how my current credit is calculated, and what there are to prevent me from it so in the future? I really don't want to find myself in this situation again. It's just too stressful.

Speaker 2: reassuring) I completely your anxiety, Mr./Mrs. [Client's Last Name], and I want to reassure you that are activating this temporary increase right away.
Typing on keyboard
Speaker 2: Yes, to be ab solutely clear, we will increase your limit by 500 [Currency] above your current limit, bringing your total temporary limit to [Current Limit 500] [Currency]. This will be effective almost immediately, allowing you to ocmplete your purchase, and it will remain valid for days. I can also confirm once more that are no fees associated with this temprary adjustment, and it will not negatively impact your credit history. You can rest assured on those points.

Speaker 2: Now, regardin how your current credit limit is actually calculated, uh, it's a dynamic process that considers several factors. We look at your income, your overall banking relationship with us, your spending patterns, and any existing financial liabilities you might have. Our internal risk assessment models also play a role in determining a limit that is suitable and responsible for your financial profile. To help youprevent this from happening again, and, uh, is quite useful, I can suggest up real-time transaction alerts throuhg E-Banking or the UBS Access App. way, you'll receive a notificatoin as you approach your limit, giving you time to react. We can also, you know, schedule a separate discussion to review your overall spending habits and potetially discuss a permanent limit increase that aligns better with your should you wis h.
Pause
Sepaker Now that we've addressed your immediate card situation, which I trust will be resolved within the next few minutes, I do need to move on to the second important point for today, which is updating your Know Your Customer, or KYC, information. This is a requirement for all financial institutions, you know, to ensure we have the most current understanding of clients' financial situations to remain compliant. For this, I need to confirm some of your asset details. I have here that your total assets are 7,924,733 [Currency]. Can you please confirm this figure for me? Is that, uh, broadly

Speaker 1: (Excels audibly, relieved) Okay, oh, that's a huge, huge relief about card limit, thank you so much for processing that quickly. I really, really hope those alerts, um, will help prevent this stress in the future.

Speaker 1: Now, uh, regarding the KYC update... yes, my total assets are indeed around 7,924,733 That figure correct. However, I'm just a bit anxious and, frankly, confused about why this update needed right now, why youneed such a detailed breakdown of my assets into real estate, liquid, and other categories. What's the specific purpose of all this detailed financial and, like, how is it actually used? I'm also quite concerned about data privacy how secure this sensitive information will be, you know? Will updating information impact my current services, my credit limit (again, linking back to the previous issue, I'm still a bit worried that), or evenfuture investment opportunities? And what does it mean when it says "Assets diversified"? How does the bank perceive my profile based on that remark? It just sounds a bit... vague, I guess.

Speaker (Patiently and empathetically) Mr./Mrs. [Client's Last Name], I completely, completely understand your anxiety and your questions regarding the update. It's perfectly natural to want to know why we need this information and precisely how handled, so thank you for asking.

Speaker First, uh, regarding the of this update right now: Know Your Customer, or KYC as we it, is a fundamental regulatory requirement for all financial institutions here in Switzerland, and indeed, globally.

By periodically updating this information, we ensure that we are compliant with these regulations and, equally important, that we have an up-to-date understanding of your financial situation. This, in turn, allows us to you with the most advice and products, tailored to your specific needs and risk profile.

Speaker 2: The reason we request a detailed breakdown of your assets – into real estate, liquid, and otherc ate gori es – is precisely to gain that comrehensive understanding.

It actually allows us better assess your ifnancial capacity, wihch can potentially support discussions for a permanent credit limit increase, should you desire one, as it paints a clearer of your overall financial For investments, a detailed understanding your assets helps us tailor investment strategies that are truly aligned with your wealth structure, objectives, and risk appetite, potentially unlocking more suitabel and sophisticated opportunities.

Speaker 2: And when it states "Asets are diversified," uh, simply means that your wealth is spread across various asset classes, th an being concentrated in just one or two. This is generally a very positive remark, as diversification is a key principle in financial management. It suggests a well-structured fnancial profile, which indicates a lower overall risk exposure and a more resilient portfolio. For the it means we perceive you as a client with a thoughtful approach to wealth management, making easier for to discuss and propose tailored, comprehensive financial strategies.
