Client Advisor: Good Morning, Mr. NAME. This is NAME1 from UBS, and I'm calling to discuss the recent concerns regarding your blocked card and to address any inquiries you might have related to the unblocking process. Before we go into details, may I kindly ask you to confirm your date of birth and address for security purposes?
Client: My date of birth is DATE, and I live at ADDRESS.
Client Advisor: Thank you for that information. Now, regarding your blocked card, I'm relieved to inform you that it was a precautionary measure due to some unusual activity detected. To proceed, we'll need to verify this activity with you and then go through a security verification process. Once that's complete, your card will be unblocked.

To prevent such issues in the future, I recommend updating your contact information so that you receive immediate notifications about suspicious transactions. We could also discuss getting a replacement card or using mobile payment options temporarily.

Regarding security measures, our systems are designed to detect potential fraud early to protect your finances. Nevertheless, I want to assure you that we will address this promptly and ensure long-term security for you.

In addition, I noticed we have some updates to your KYC information. Could you confirm the purpose of your business relationship as payments, primarily for retirement investments? Also, could you verify if you're currently employed in a Sales function with Company 3 in the Healthcare sector?
Client: Yes, that's correct. My business relationship primarily involves payments and is focused on investing for my retirement. And I'm indeed working in Sales with Company 3 in the Healthcare sector. I'm relieved to hear that the card was blocked as a precautionary measure. Could you tell me what specific activity triggered this action? Also, how long will the verification and unblocking process take?
Client Advisor: The unusual activity that triggered the blocking of your card was a series of attempted transactions overseas, which appeared inconsistent with your usual spending pattern. As a safety protocol, our system flagged these for review. Regarding the verification and unblocking process, once you've reviewed these transactions and confirmed them, we'll initiate the unblocking, which typically takes about 24 to 48 hours. Meanwhile, is there anything else you'd like us to assist you with to facilitate this process, such as getting a temporary replacement card or using our mobile payment facilities? Additionally, we aim to ensure this kind of disruption doesn't happen again, so we'd be happy to update your contact details to keep you informed of any suspicious activities immediately.
Client: It's definitely reassuring to know that the block was just a precaution. I appreciate that. For clarity, could you explain the steps I need to take for the security verification? Also, if it's going to take 24 to 48 hours for the unblocking process, what options do I have in the meantime for accessing my funds or handling any urgent payments? I'm also interested in making sure this doesn't happen again, so I'd like to update my contact information as suggested. Moreover, since you mentioned retirement planning, could we confirm the details for the scheduled video call on 2025-10-04, and let me know what I should prepare for it?
Client Advisor: I'm glad you find it reassuring. For the security verification, you'll need to confirm the details of the overseas transactions that were flagged. We'll send you a secure link shortly to review them, and once you've confirmed or disputed those transactions, we'll proceed with the unblocking. As for accessing your funds in the interim, you can apply for a temporary replacement card, which usually arrives within a few days, or alternatively, use our mobile payment services which are linked to your account.

Regarding the upcoming retirement planning video call scheduled for 2025-10-04, it will be a 30-minute session via the provided video link. During the call, we'll discuss your retirement strategy and suggest any necessary portfolio adjustments. To get the most out of our meeting, it would be best to have gathered recent financial statements and any questions or goals you have regarding your retirement plans. Moreover, we can update your contact information now to ensure seamless communication in the future.
Client: Thank you for explaining the verification process clearly. I'll review the transactions once I receive the secure link. In the meantime, I'll go ahead with the temporary mobile payments option to manage my urgent payments. For the contact information update, could you guide me on the quickest way to ensure everything is up-to-date? I'm quite relieved that this is being handled efficiently. Also, I'll prepare the necessary documents for our retirement planning video call, and it's good to know we'll have a structured session. If there’s anything specific you recommend I focus on, do let me know.
