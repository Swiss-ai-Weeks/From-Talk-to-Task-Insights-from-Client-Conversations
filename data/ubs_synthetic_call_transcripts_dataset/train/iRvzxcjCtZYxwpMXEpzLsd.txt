Speaker 2:Oh, wait, I almost forgot—oh, sorry, that's not what I meant. hu-huh, got it.

Speaker 1:So, there are fees involved including late payment if overdraft isn't cleared within the specified duration, and account maintenance fees relatd to the overdraft itself. Also, using an overdaft can impact your credit score, but there are ways to mitigate any negative effects. Any questions on that?

Speaker 2:Thank s for the breakdown. Can you clarify the specific late payment penalties and how the account maintenance fees are calulated?
