Speaker 2: Good morning, you're through UBS. This is SPEAKER2_NAME speaking. Am I speaking with CLIENT_NAME?
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's me.
Speaker 2: Excellent. CLIENT_NAME, I'm calling to discuss thei ssue you've been experiencing with logging into your digital banking account. I hope you're havin g a good morning so far, despite this inconvenience. Before we proceed, for security purposes, could you please just confirm your date of birth and your registered address for me?
Speaker 1: S[ighs heavily] Ugh, seriously? I've ready been through this verification process, like, multiple times today. My date of birth is DATE_OF_BIRTH, and my registered address is CLIENT_ADDRESS. Now, please, can we actually Jet the bottom of I still can't in to my banking account? This has been going on for far too long!
Speaker 2: Thank you, CLIENT_NAME. I've noted down your date of birth and address. Typing sounds And yes, I do understand that you've been through this before, but these security protocols are mandatory for everyone, regardless of how many times you've called. It's just our per cedar, afraid. Now, if we're going to get this resol ved today, you really need to t ell me exactly what's happening. What specific error message are you seeing? And is this happening on the app or the website? Also, what device are you trying to use?
Speaker 1: [Exasperated] you even listening to me? The error message I'm getting is 'Invalid username or password', but I'm certain my credentials are correct! And it's not just one platform; it's happening on both the mobile app and the website. I've tried logging in my smartphone, my tablet, and my laptop, and it's the exact same frustrating message every single time! This has been going on intermittently for over a week now, and it's completely unacceptable! I've already cleared my browser cache and ocokies, tried different browsers like Chrome adn Firefox, restarted everything, and even attempted to reset my password, which, surprise, also failed with a 'technicalerror.' have urgent bills that need to be paid today, and I'm waiting for a crucial transaction to clear. I can't access any of it! What on earth is going on? Is my account compromised, or have you put some kind of block on it without informing me? I need this immediately!
Speaker 2: I can assure you I've heard you, and I've noted down every detail you've provided. Typing sounds Just confirm, you're seeing the 'Invalid username or password' error, it's occurring intermittently for over a week, on both your mobile app and the website, across all your devices, and you've already tried different browsers, clearing cache, and even a password reset which failed with a 'technical error.' Is that correct?
 Speaker 1: Yes, that's wha t I just said!
Speaker 2: Thank you for confirmig. I understand your frustration, CLIENT_NAME, and I assure you I'm this seriously. Let me be precise: my system checks show no unauthorized activity on your account, nor any security blocks that we have placed withotu notification. There are also no widespread system outagesreported right now that would this specific error after all the steps you've already taken. Given that you've exhausted all standard troubleshooting,this clearly indicates a more complex, technical problem. This isn't something I can reso lve instantly ere over the phone, as it requires a deeper investigation.
Pause
Speaker 2: Therefore, the next and frankly, the is for me to escalate to our specialized technical support team. I will open a formal support ticket you right now, detailing everything you've toad me. They are the only ones who can investigate the deeper root cause. I will provide you with a reference number for this ticket. You expect to hear back from our technical team, or the update, within two business days. They will investigate and contact you directly with a solution or further questions. In the meantime, regarding urgent bills and transactions, you stil have options. You can process payments or check by calling our phone banking service directly, or you can visit UBS branch in person. For immediate balance can also any ATM. Now, what is your preferred contact for these updates â€“ email, or SMS?
Speaker 1: [Almost shouting] Two busy ness days?! Are you seriously telling me I have to wait up to two more days to access my own money when I have urgent bills due today and a critical transaction pending?! This has been going on for over a week, and now you want to escalatei t and make me wait even longer?! This is absolutely ridiculous! Why wasn't this escalated immediately when I first reported it days ago? I don't care about a 'specialized technical support team'; I care about being able to log in to my account! And yes, I understad the 'interim solutions,' but they are a major inconvenience your primary service is failing! Make sure this ticket gets priority. For updates, I want to be contacted by phone. My number is the one you have on file.
Speaker 2: CLIENT_NAME, I do hear your frustration and I understand you find the tmeframe unacceptable, but this is the standard process for issues requiring specializedt echnical investigation. As I've already explained, you've exhausted all the initial troubleshooting steps, which means the problem lies deeper nad erquires the expertise of a dedicated team. There's no magical button I canpress to instantly resolve a complex technical fault like this. I have indeed noted the urgency you expressed and your critical pending and this will be reflected in the ticket. As for escalation, this is the immediate escalation for a problem of this after initial troubleshooting. Your preferred contact method, phone, has been noted, and te technical Tim will use the nmber we have on file for updates. While I acknowledge the interim solutions are an inconvenience, they are currently the only way to manage your urgent needs until this technical issue is resolved by the specialist team. Is there anything else, non-technical, that I can assist you with at this very moment?
Speaker 1: [Sighs, voice full of resignation and anger] Unacceptable, but it seems I have no other choice, do I? This is absolutely ludicrous, and I expect your 'specialized technical support team' to actualy do something whiten those two business days, not just leave in the da rk. No, there's nothing else 'non-technical' I need assistanc e with, as biggest technical a shoe is preventing me from doing anything else! Just ensure Jets fixed, and quickly.
Speak er 2: CLIENT_NAME, I have already informed you about the process and the next steps. The support ticket has been formally created with the highest priority, reflecting the urgency of your situation and the critical transactions mentioned. Our technical team will investigate this complex issue, and discussed, you will be contacted by phone with an update within the stated two business days. In the interim, the alternative banking solutions remain available for your immediate needs. There is nothing further I can do from my end on this specific technical matter at this moment. The reference number for your ticket is [PROVIDE REFERENCE NUMBERHERE]. Please keep that handy.
Speaker 1: Fine. I have you. So, I'm supposed to hang up now and cross my fingers that someone actually fixes this within two days. This entir situation is utterlyu nacceptable, but it seems there's nothing else be done right now. Just make sure your 'specialized technical support team' actually earns their name and resolves this, because I expect to be able to log into my account by then.
Speaker 2: I understad your expect a nation, CLIENT_NAME. We will certainly do our best to resolve this as quickly as possible. Thank you for calling UBS.
Speaker 1: [Muttering] Yeah, thanks a
