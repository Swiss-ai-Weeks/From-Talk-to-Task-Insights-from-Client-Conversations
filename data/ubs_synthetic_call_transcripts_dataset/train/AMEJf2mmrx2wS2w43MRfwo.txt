Speaker 1: Uh, good morning. Is this UBS? Can you, uh, help me with some issues I've been having? 

Speaker 2: Yes, good morning, Mr. uh... NAME. This is NAME1 here from UBS. I believe we need to discuss some things today, including a charge you didn’t recognize on your statement and some estate planning questions. But before we, um, dive into that, could I verify your date of birth and address, please? It's just for security.

Speaker 1: Oh sure, no problem. My date of birth is DATE, and my address is... uh ADDRESS.

Speaker 2: Thank you for confirming that, Mr. NAME. Alright, so about that unrecognized charge you mentioned. I’ve, uh, checked your transactions, and I see one on DATE for AMOUNT, to the merchant NAME2. Do you think someone in your household could have possibly authorized it, or is it still not something you recognize?

Speaker 1: Umm, no. This is like the third time I’m calling about the same charge. It wasn’t authorized by anyone. I really need to understand how this slipped through and what we can do to fix it. And I'm worried there might be more. Can we, like, go through my recent transactions just to be sure there are no more surprises?

Speaker 2: I completely understand your frustration, Mr. NAME. Definitely not what you want to be dealing with, especially if this isn't the first time. Let's take a deep dive. I’ll ensure we dispute it properly. We can also review your recent activity together, and I think setting up transaction alerts might help. They’ll notify you right away if something unusual pops up. We can, um, chat about prevention measures too. After we handle this, should we move on to those estate questions?

Speaker 1: Sure, thanks for tackling the security issues. Let's do a review now and then help me out with setting up those alerts. How do they work, actually? Do they ping me immediately if something sketchy happens? And yeah, after things are sorted, I’d love to know more on estate planning.

Speaker 2: Thanks for your patience. So, let's look at your transactions first. I’ll read out each one from this past month. Just let me know if anything's suspicious. About alerts—they're pretty nifty! You set a minimum amount and, uh, every time your card hits that number, you get a notification, either by email or SMS, so you catch anything fishy right away. And after that, I’ve got info on estate planning like wills and trusts ready for you. Are you good to go over your transactions now?

Speaker 1: Yep, I’m ready. Let’s review those transactions. And, uh, are those alerts hard to set up, or do I need to do something extra? Want them running soon to keep my account tight.

Speaker 2: Alright, let's... let’s go through them. First up, the transaction on DATE for AMOUNT to NAME2, which we already flagged. Let me know as we go if anything else seems off. The alerts are straightforward to set up. When we're done, I’ll walk you through it, no worries. Okay, ready for the next one?

Speaker 1: Yes, go ahead. Want to be thorough. As for alerts, really need them ASAP. Let's finish this review so I can get peace of mind.

Speaker 2: Let’s see. Next one is DATE, AMOUNT, at NAME3. Is this one okay? Once we've got those checked, the alert setup will be quick. And about the estate planning—how does September 9, 2025, sound for a meeting in our branch? We can dig into the details on wills, trusts, and all that.

Speaker 1: Yes, I recall that one—it's all correct. Keep going, please. Wanna be sure there's nothing sneaky going on here. And yes, the meeting on September 9 sounds perfect. Looking forward to making sure everything's in line for the fam.

Speaker 2: Great, moving right along. NEXT transaction dated DATE, AMOUNT with NAME4—do you recognize this? We'll wrap up, set alerts, and secure everything. Glad to hear the meeting date works; it’s important to get those family plans sorted. Anything else looks off in the list?

Speaker 1: Recognize that too. Everything seems normal so far, but let’s just double-check the rest. Those alerts are a must ASAP. Thanks for arranging the meeting; can’t wait to secure our future family finances.

Speaker 2: Got it, Mr. NAME. Let's quickly finish these checks. Next up... DATE, AMOUNT, NAME5—sound right? We’ll get those alerts running next and, uh, reduce any future hassles. September 9 is noted for estate planning, where we’ll cover everything crucial. Let me know if nothing stands out, and we can move to the alerts.

Speaker 1: Yep, that one is legit too. Almost done, right? Really keen on setting up those alerts as fast as we can—too long spent sorting this. Appreciate everything you’ve got rolling for the meeting, seems like a good next step.
