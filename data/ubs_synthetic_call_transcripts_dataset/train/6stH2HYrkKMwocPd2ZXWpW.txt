Speaker 1: Uh, hello, good morning. Is this UBS? 

Speaker 2: Good morning! Yes, it is. This is NAME1 from UBS. Is this Mr. NAME? 

Speaker 1: Yeah, that's me.

Speaker 2: Excellent. I'm calling you regarding the recent block on your card and I wanted to, um, help you with any concerns you might have about it. Uh, before we continue, could you confirm your date of birth and address, just for verification purposes?

Speaker 1: Sure, um, my date of birth is DATE and, uh, my address is ADDRESS.

Speaker 2: Perfect, thank you for confirming that. So, I understand you might be a bit worried about why the card got blocked. Usually, this happens because our system detected some spending activities that might seem, uh, suspicious. Have you noticed any unusual transactions lately that perhaps you didn't recognize?

Speaker 1: Uh, yeah, actually, I did see a couple of charges that seemed strange. They were from companies I haven't heard of, and it got me kinda worried. But seriously, does the card need to be blocked so easily? Can't the system, like, ask for a verification instead?

Speaker 2: I understand your concerns; it's definitely frustrating when these measures kick in unexpectedly. Our priority is to protect your account from any unauthorized transactions. Our monitoring system works in real-time to catch anything unusual, and sometimes it can be a bit overzealous. Regarding those transactions, I can launch a deeper look into them. Could you let me know the dates and amounts so I can cross-check if they were responsible for the block?

Speaker 1: Sure, let's see... uh, one charge was for around AMOUNT on DATE, and another one was AMOUNT on DATE1. Do those ring any bells as the ones that triggered the block? Also, about the card monitoring service you mentioned, that sounds good. Could having my card blocked for, you know, a few days, mess up any automatic payments I have going?

Speaker 2: Thanks for those details. I'll definitely check if those were the transactions involved and see if any automatic payments were affected. The card monitoring service will help notify you early if there's unusual activity, hopefully nipping problems in the bud. Since your card's blocked, you might need to swing by a branch to resolve this. Want me to give you the info on what to bring, and whether an appointment is needed?

Speaker 1: Yeah, that'd be helpful. Also, what's the general timeline? I want to make sure that, once I make it to the branch, the card gets unblocked quickly. And could you also tell me if the block might be affecting any other of my accounts?

Speaker 2: Absolutely, I totally get those concerns. Typically, a block only affects the specific card, but I'll double-check just to be sure. When you head to the branch, bring some valid ID and your blocked card. An appointment isn't strictly necessary, but it might speed things up, so I'd say calling ahead would be wise. Once you've resolved this at a branch, your card should be back in action, usually by the end of the day. I'm here to help and make sure you don't have to deal with too much disruption. If you have more questions or need something else, just let us know.

Speaker 1: Thank you for the info. I'll gather the stuff I need and probably set up an appointment. Thanks for helping make sure my finances donâ€™t go haywire.
