Speaker 1: Oh, hi there, um, I guess I need some help with my, uh, account. I'm a bit confused about some updates and, uh, the card block situation. 

Speaker 2: Good morning! This is NAME1 from UBS. I'm calling to discuss, uh, important updates regarding your account, especially about the recent card block. But first, how are you today? And for security reasons, could you please verify your date of birth and address for me?

Speaker 1: Uh, sure, no problem. My date of birth is DATE and my address is ADDRESS.

Speaker 2: Great, thank you for confirming those details. Now, about the card block—it can be a bit confusing. Your card was blocked due to what our system saw as, hmm, unusual transactions—kind of out of your regular spending pattern. But, don't worry, we checked and there were no fraudulent activities. Want to go through these transactions, or is there anything else you’re unclear about?

Speaker 1: Uh, yeah, I'm not really sure what you mean by "transactions out of my regular pattern." Could you, like, explain what kind of transactions set this off? And while I’m waiting for the new card, is there anything I can do? Also, I moved recently... Can you update my address so the new card goes to ADDRESS?

Speaker 2: Certainly! So, those transactions were, um, unusually high and, uh, not what you typically spend. That's what triggered our security systems. But, rest assured, we've reviewed them and found no fraudulent transactions. 

Speaker 2: While you wait for the new card, I recommend using digital payment solutions like Apple Pay or Google Wallet, if those are set up—they'll let you access your funds. I'll update your address right away, so the new card will be sent to your current location. And you've mentioned you'd prefer to manage communications via email; is that right?

Speaker 1: Yeah, that's right, email for all the legal stuff too, please. Oh, and, um, about the card, will it cost me anything extra for sending the new one? And how long till it arrives? What do I need to do about recurring payments or subscriptions that were on my old card? Also, um, about my, uh, KYC updates... especially with the inheritance—I don't quite get how they'll affect my account. Any documents I should provide?

Speaker 2: I'll adjust those email preferences ensuring all legal and general information is sent to your email. The new card should arrive in, usually, 5 to 7 business days, and there’s no charge for sending it. For recurring payments, once you get the new card, update those details to avoid interruptions. 

And for your KYC updates concerning your inheritance, you'll need documentary evidence, like the inheritance documents. It's, uh, mandatory for our records — to stay compliant with regulations and really, to make sure your asset profile is accurate. Maintaining current documents prevents any negative impact on your account.

Speaker 1: Okay, I see now. Thanks for that. Uh, what documents do you need for the, uh, inheritance stuff? And for my assets, what advantages does diversification bring me? I’d like to know more about balancing liquidity and maximizing returns. Can we talk about this more at our meeting on, uh, the 7th of September?

Speaker 2: Yes, September 7th at 9:00 AM is confirmed! I'll draft an agenda for that meeting. For inheritance, usually official documents like a will or inheritance certificate are needed—just make sure they're clear and verifiable. 

As for diversification, it helps optimize returns by balancing your portfolio—it keeps you liquid while reducing exposure to market volatility. We’ll discuss diversification strategies and their benefits fully.

Speaker 2: I’ll get your contact changes updated, and ensure your new card is sent to the right address. If there’s anything more you’re curious about or unsure of, let me know, and we’ll address it all at our meeting.
