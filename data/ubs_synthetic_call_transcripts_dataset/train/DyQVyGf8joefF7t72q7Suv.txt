Now, regarding your new card, we'll have it issued and delivered to your updated address in Bulle, Fribourg, with postal region 1630. Usually, it takes about 7-10 business days for a new card to be delivered. Meanwhile, we can provide you with a temporary card or alternative payment method to use in the interim at no additional cost. Should you have any concerns about fees related to the card replacement, I'm here to clarify that these will be waived given the situation. Does this address your concerns so far related to your card?
Client: Yes, that certainly helps to put my mind at ease about the card replacement process, thank you. I’d like to confirm my updated postal address once more to ensure there won’t be any issues with the delivery. Also, I'm curious about the temporary card option.

Could you please proceed with setting it up for me? Additionally, while we're going through these updates, I want to ensure that my KYC information is accurate.
