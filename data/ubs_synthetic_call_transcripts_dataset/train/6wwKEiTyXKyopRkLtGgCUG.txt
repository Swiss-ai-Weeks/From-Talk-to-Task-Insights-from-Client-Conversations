Speaker 1: Uh, good morning. Uh, I think it's NAME from UBS, is it?

Speaker 2: Yes, good morning, Mr. NAME. This is NAME1. How are you today? I'm calling to discuss those, um, unrecognized charges you've noticed, and also some of your account management questions and KYC details. But first, could I, uh, could I just verify your identity? Could you confirm your date of birth and address?

Speaker 1: Sure, my date of birth is DATE, and the address is ADDRESS.

Speaker 2: Great, thank you for that. So, uh, you mentioned some concerns about an unrecognized charge on your account. Can you tell me more about it? Like, the date, the amount, or anything you know about the merchant? We're here to sort this out for you, and I can guide you on immediate steps to secure your account.

Speaker 1: Yeah, the charge was on DATE for AMOUNT. I honestly don't remember making that transaction, and the merchant name doesn't ring a bell either. I'm not really sure how to proceed, you know, to keep my account secure. Also, could you, um, explain the protection UBS offers against such fraudulent activities? And should I be thinking about replacing my card?

Speaker 2: Absolutely, I can imagine how worrying this must be. We definitely offer some robust fraud protection policies here at UBS to guard against unauthorized transactions. If it's indeed fraudulent, we'll investigate and potentially reverse the charge. As for immediate steps, we should probably replace your card to prevent more unauthorized transactions. And, uh, setting up transaction alerts could be a good idea to help you monitor any activities in real-time. Don't worry; we'll ensure it doesn't affect your credit score. Do you want me to proceed with a card replacement?

Speaker 1: Yes, that sounds good. Please go ahead with the card replacement and alert setup. Also, regarding my account preferences, can you confirm that my communication preference is, uh, set to email? And, I heard something about inheritance documentation for KYC updates—do I need to do anything else? Oh, and one more thing: My unemployment status—how might it affect my banking services? And, is our meeting still on for 2025-09-08 at 09:00?

Speaker 2: Let's take these one by one. Your communication preference is currently set to email for most updates, but legal communications might still come via post due to regulations. For the inheritance documentation, you've provided a link for the evidence, and I'll check if additional documents are necessary. About your unemployment status, it doesn't impact your services right now, but banks periodically review profiles. And yes, your meeting for 2025-09-08 at 09:00 is confirmed. If there's anything more you want to add to discuss there, just let me know.

Speaker 1: Thanks for confirming the details about the card and alerts. Just double-checking—how do the email communications work with this, uh, blocked delivery thing for legal information? Do I need to do anything else to ensure my contact info is correctly updated?

Speaker 2: Sure thing! The blocked delivery validity means that even though your preference is for emails, some legal documents might still need posting. No need to worry—initial notifications will still come via email. Right now, no further action is needed from your side regarding email communications; it's all set. We want to make sure all your preferences are noted. Is there anything else you'd like us to cover before your meeting?

Speaker 1: Got it. Thanks for clearing that up. I'll try the online portal and app, but any chance someone can help before our meeting, just to be sure I'm on track? Also, could you, uh, let me know about the KYC update status and if any more inheritance documents are needed?

Speaker 2: Definitely, I can arrange for a team member to assist you with the setup. And, rest assured, I'll check on the KYC status and get back to you promptly if anything more is needed. We want all your queries resolved smoothly. Anything else on your mind before we finish up?
